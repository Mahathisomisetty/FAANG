# Dom
Document object model
# javascript
There are 3 types of js:
1. Inline
2. Internal
3. External
mostly we have to write script in the end of the tags in the html
# alert function
```<script>
alert("hello");
<script>
```
it creates a popup box
Ex:alert.html 
# document.getelementbyid
we can change text with help of this 
example:innertext.html
